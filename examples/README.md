## Examples notebooks

- `0 - TangoSIDM_data.ipynb`: example notebook to use the hdf5 datasets contain in the `data/TangoSIDM/` folder.
- `1 - data_selection.ipynb`: notebook to explore the distribution in mass and pericenter of the satellite sample used in the analysis. 
- `2 - orbits.ipynb`: notebook to plot the orbit of satellite halos (in the specific examples IDs of halos previously matched between boxes are given). 
- `3 - density_fit.ipynb`: notebook to fit density profiles with isothermal and NFW profiles.
- `4 - satellite_properties.ipynb`: notebook to plot internal structure of halos (density at 150 pc and circular velocity at fiducial radius) versus pericenter distance, color coded by different quantities.
- `5 - satellite_properties_with_Gaia.ipynb`: similar notebook to `4 - satellite_properties.ipynb`, but including data from the Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies as measured by Gaia (data in folder `data/Gaia/`).
