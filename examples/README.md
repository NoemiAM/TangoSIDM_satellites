## Examples notebooks

- `0 - TangoSIDM_data.ipynb`: explanatory notebook of the structure of the hdf5 datasets containe in [`data/TangoSIDM/`](https://github.com/NoemiAM/TangoSIDM_satellites/tree/main/data/TangoSIDM).
- `1 - data_selection.ipynb`: notebook to explore the distribution in mass and pericenter of the satellite sample used in the analysis. 
- `2 - orbits.ipynb`: notebook to plot the orbit of satellite halos (in the specific examples IDs of halos previously matched between boxes are given). 
- `3 - density_fit.ipynb`: notebook to fit density profiles with isothermal and NFW profiles.
- `4 - satellite_properties.ipynb`: notebook to plot internal structure of halos (density at 150 pc and circular velocity at fiducial radius) versus pericenter distance, color coded by different quantities.
- `5 - density_pericenter_simulations.ipynb`: notebook to fit inner density - pericenter relation.
- `6 - density_pericenter_slope.ipynb`: notebook to quantify scatter in the slope of the fit inner density - pericenter relation under different density profiles.
- `7 - density_halo_mass.ipynb`: notebook for inner density - peak mass relation.
