Table 1 from Cardona-Barrero et al., 2023, MMNRAS, 522, 2, 3058. Each file corresponds to a given spheroidal galaxy (Cardona_2023_XXX.csv). 
The first six rows correspond to the pericenter (kpc) determined by 
1: Fritz et al. (2018) (for a MW galaxy of 8e11 Msun and based on Gaia DR2)
2: Battaglia et al. (2022) (for an Isolated MW galaxy of 8.8e11 Msun), 
3: Battaglia et al. (2022) (for an Isolated MW galaxy of 1.6e12 Msun), 
4: Battaglia et al. (2022) (for an MW galaxy of 8.8e11 Msun perturbed by a 1.5e11 Msun LMC), 
5: Pace et al. (2022) (for a MW galaxy of 1.3e12 Msun and based on Gaia DR3)
6: Pace et al. (2022) (for a MW galaxy of 1.3e12 Msun perturbed by a 1.38e11 Msun LMC, and based on Gaia DR3)
The following four rows correspond to the central density at 150 pc (1e7 Msun / kpc^3) given by
1: Read et al. (2019),
2: Hayashi et al. (2020),
3: Kaplinghat et al. (2019) (assuming NFW profile)
4: Kaplinghat et al. (2019) (assuming cored-density profile)
The various columns correspond to the 50th, (-)16th, (+)84th percentiles
